                                In my last blog post, I questioned and indeed critiqued the notion that entrepreneurship is to be the vehicle with which Africa solves her most immediate issues. Issues ranging from poverty, high unemployment, a majority youth populous, majority of whom are idle. While that blog was poignant, it barely began to scratch the surface of how ill-suited for large scale entrepreneurship the current African setup is. In this article, I am going to continue to expound on what I believe to be one of the main hindrances to Africa's 'development by entrepreneurship' goal. It is my position that successful systemic, large scale entrepreneurship is a very difficult endeavor to achieve because of the role setup for and played by post-colonial Africa in the knowledge economy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But before I can successfully defend my position, it is imperative to define this notion of a 'knowledge economy' from both the global community's perspective and the African perspective. I have found that these two perspectives arrive at somewhat different definitions of the 'knowledge economy' and that it is in these different definitions that we will find the limitations of post-colonial Africa in its quest to become a 'Net Entrepreneurial society' (see my definition of this in the last blog).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Let’s begin with the globally accepted definition of the term 'knowledge economy'. Generally speaking, the term 'knowledge economy' pertains to an economy where production and services are based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technological and scientific advance as well as equally rapid obsolescence (Powell, Snellman, The Knowledge Economy 2004). In other words, a knowledge economy is an economy where majority of the value added or created is not from agro-business but rather from technology, intellectual property and research. Where in the past most of the developed economies thrived on low technology sectors like manual high-labor intensive agriculture, mining, and factories employing blue collar workers building low tech products, now the developed economies thrive on a technology based service industry which is predominantly online (e.g. Facebook, Amazon, Uber), research and development of new technologies (not their manufacture though) and sophisticated financial markets that aren't trading any tangible goods. Experts argue that this shift in focus in the global economy happened as a result of heavier investment into research and development as well as a widespread integration with technology across different industries in the economy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So how does Africa fit into this economy? And furthermore, what does entrepreneurship in Africa have to do with it? In order to answer this, we need to expound on the 'economy' part of 'knowledge economy' as well. From an economic perspective, the knowledge economy could simply be defined as an economy in which the main product is 'knowledge'. Furthermore, since it is an economy, we can use basic demand and supply economic theory to organize this 'knowledge economy'. And just like any other economy, the knowledge economy has manufacturers, a supply chain, a market price as well as customers. And just like any other product, knowledge is imported and exported from one country to another. It is here that we can begin to understand how Africa fits into this economy. As mentioned in the last paragraph, the developed countries have taken on the role of knowledge creators (manufacturers) in this economy of knowledge. For example many American companies have Research and Development (R&D) departments which are crucial to their business operations. In addition to this, a lot of the developed economies systematically invest in research in science and technology through their various research institutions and universities. It is my argument that Africa (as a continent) is a net importer of knowledge. Furthermore, I believe that Africa has been importing knowledge since long before the term 'knowledge economy was coined'.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Africa's culture of importing, rather than creating knowledge has more to do with the legacy of colonization than with the knowledge economy itself. Colonization saw Africans give up locally sourced knowledge and knowledge creation systems in exchange for western knowledge. The definition of the knowledge economy is limited to knowledge within the realms of technology and industry, but Africa has been importing a wide range of 'knowledges' since the dawn of colonialism. Where we had once relied on local leaders, tribal elders for the knowledge on which our social structures and constructs, we abandoned those in favor of imports from our colonizers. We have imported education systems, imported political systems and social organization systems. Our judicial systems are imported and perhaps most significantly, our history about ourselves and our continent is also imported. With this in mind, it should not surprise anyone that in the modern day knowledge economy, Africa is still a net importer. This is not to say that importing knowledge is wrong, it is not. However, when the knowledge being imported is as fundamental to the operation and development of society, importing has left Africa vulnerable and at the mercy of the knowledge manufactures and exporters in so many ways, as we are going to see below.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As mentioned above, importing such fundamental knowledge has put Africa at the mercy of the knowledge producers, just like the way importing knowledge by way of colonization left Africa at the mercy of its various colonial masters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The other main consequence of being a net importer of knowledge is the fact that we are removed from the knowledge creation process, and thus we only get to see it as a finished product. This creates a static, set in stone understanding of knowledge, which couldn't be further from the truth.
