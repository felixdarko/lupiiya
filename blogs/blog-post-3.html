                                One of the things that makes me proud to be a Ugandan is the strength of our communities. We have some of the strongest community setups where every individual has an immediate network of at least a dozen close friends and family members that they can rely on when in need. I have attended funerals in Uganda that happen a day or two after the deceased has passed that have been attended by hundreds, if not thousands of people that all had to travel long distances with very little notice. This is resounding evidence of the strength of our communities. I have been to a few countries even here in Africa like Ghana where funerals can happen as late as 6 months to a year after the deceased has passed. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Another significant piece of evidence of the strength of our communities and the main focus of this article is the crowd funding culture that exists in our society. Majority of social events in Uganda are crowd funded. Almost every Ugandan adult has attended a wedding meeting at one point or another and has contributed to a wedding of either a friend or family member. However, while weddings are the most obvious evidence of the crowdfunding culture, they aren’t the only evidence. Graduation parties, medical expenses and funerals are all expenses that are routinely crowd funded in Uganda. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I went to a traditional catholic all boys’ high school in Uganda for my O level. Some of the finest moments we ever had on campus were the ties we would come together as a class or even as an entire student body to contribute funds for a fellow student who for whatever reason couldn’t afford to pay the school fees that term. This is just one of example of how crowdfunding works organically in our society.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                How it typically works is that the funds are raised from the family and friends networks of the concerned party and those friends and family members raise more money from their own networks and so on until the target amount of the campaign is reached. Each donor contributes a small amount that they have and bit by bit the ‘crowd’ raises the entire amount required. The funds are raised without any expectation of profit or even repayment from the donors, but are given as part of the donors’ perceived social obligations to their community and to the community member that is in need. This is basically part of the social contract that exists in Ugandan society.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However while crowdfunding for social events can be characterized as part of Uganda’s social contract, the support of the Friends and Family networks that people have goes far beyond that, especially when talking about the youth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to the data from our Youth Credit Outlook Survey 2019, one in every 2 young people goes to their family and friends as their main source of credit financing. The youth also reported that the main factors they consider when seeking credit were the cost of the credit (xx%) and also the bureaucracy and red tape involved in the credit process (xx%). This indicates to me that the Friends and Family financing option is the most convenient and affordable financing option available to the youth. Therefore I feel comfortable concluding that this is the strongest support system for the youth and the entrepreneurs among them in Uganda.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But all this good news does come with a grain of salt. Particularly for the entrepreneurs among the youth. Despite having such a strong crowdfunding culture and the high dependency of the youth on the Friends and Family networks for credit, the entrepreneurs aren’t getting their fair share of this social support. Entrepreneurs don’t have anywhere to go to access affordable financing for their businesses. As much as I am happy to see this indigenous culture of fundraising manifest in Ugandan society, I am also frustrated by the fact this social crowdfunding culture has not been extended to the entrepreneurs in our society so we can make it easier for them to raise capital for their businesses. It is easier for a Ugandan couple planning to get married to raise 100 million from their community to finance their wedding than it is for an entrepreneur seeking to raise the same amount of money to finance his/her business which is going to impact the community by creating jobs and paying taxes. This to me comes across as an extremely frustrating failure of our community/ society.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is perhaps out of this frustration that my partners at Lupiiya and I started working on Lupiiya Hub. Lupiiya Hub is an equity crowdfunding platform we are developing which is designed to help Ugandan entrepreneurs raise capital from their communities and networks. Just like the social crowdfunding model, Lupiiya Hub gives the entrepreneur the opportunity to raise modest sums of money from hundreds, sometimes thousands of individuals in their community/ network. These modest sums all add up to a more significant crowd collection of capital that can impact the entrepreneur’s business as well as the community it is in.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However unlike the social crowdfunding model where individuals are donating their money to the social campaign without expecting any form of repayment or profit, the contributors of the capital on Lupiiya Hub get shares (equity) in the company in exchange for their contribution and therefore become investors and not donors. When the company grows, these investors will receive a share of the profits in the form of dividends. Furthermore the investor can also sell their stock (equity) in the company for a profit directly on Lupiiya Hub. We believe that this is the best solution for funding entrepreneurs since it relies on Uganda’s existing social crowdfunding culture while also giving the investor a chance to make a profit/ return on their investment.
