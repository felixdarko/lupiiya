                                According to a <a href="http://www.africaneconomicoutlook.org/en/in-depth/youth_employment/">report by the African Development Bank</a>, there are over 200 million young Africans between the ages of 15 and 24, by far the most on any continent. Furthermore, the report goes on to state that 53 million of them are in unstable employment situations, very often linked to working poverty. 40 million young Africans are out of work. Only 18 million of them are looking for a job, however, 22 million have given up looking for one.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Africa’s high youth population coupled with the lack of readily available employment to cater for these numbers is a severe challenge in this decade. Open a newspaper or scroll through an <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-za/money/news/ramaphosas-plan-to-create-2-million-jobs-for-unemployed-youth/ar-AADdegG?li=BBqfZdL">African news article</a> online and you will certainly see this issue mentioned at least once.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It has been referred to and mentioned for so long, that like any other issue, it has evolved severely, as has its coverage. What started out as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa_Rising">cautious optimism</a> about the boost that this high population of youths could potentially have on African economies has now become an <a href="https://www.fin24.com/Economy/youth-unemployment-in-sa-a-national-crisis-economists-20170807">alarm bell</a> warning of a youth crisis on the horizon across the entire continent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And what started out as <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2010/03/25/the-world-economy-calls">a scramble for</a> the unemployed African youth <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2539642/africa--the-next-frontier-of-outsourcing.html">by international</a> corporations in an effort to <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/849625/2-friends-e-jean-carroll-remember-hearing-about-alleged-assault-by-trump-new-york-times-reports">cut labor costs</a> has now morphed into an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911">international immigrant crisis</a> on European borders as educated, able bodied young Africans are abandoning their homelands by all means possible, at all costs payable, in search of greener pastures elsewhere.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But there’s a bigger monster lurking behind.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is important to note though that while the focus is mainly on unemployment, the issue of unemployment of the youth in Africa is often a double edged sword. Unemployment usually works together with his better-disguised sister, underemployment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The general trend of silence around underemployment has aided the unemployment numbers a great deal, because many of the African nations have been able to continuously post relatively low unemployment rates because their numbers have not been adjusted for underemployment. Adjust the unemployment rates for underemployment, and that tells a dramatically different story. Dramatic, yes, but not inconsistent with what is on the ground in Africa.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Take a boda boda ride in the streets of Kampala or a matatu in Nairobi, and there is a high likelihood that your rider/driver is as academically qualified as you are if not more, just probably not as well connected. Many young Africans are having to settle for work that doesn’t pay good wages, offer career advancement or provide solid job security. This is the meaning of underemployment.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Underemployment is the reason why we continue to be fed a narrative of ‘Africa is rising’ while standards of living continue to drop, unemployment continues to rise and the mass exodus of African youths from the continent gets bigger and bigger every year. The International Labour Organization (ILO), <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_513728/lang--en/index.htm">reported in 2016</a> that up to 70% of African workers were “working poor,” the highest rate globally. The organization added that “the number of poor working youth has increased by as much as 80% for the past 25 years.”
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So the reality is much worse than the picture being painted by the numbers, as bad as they are themselves. And yet after all that is said, it still gets much worse. It gets much worse because of the solution that we are being offered, as young Africans in the thick of the unemployment crisis. We are being offered a solution that is both escapist and reductionist in as far as understanding the true nature of our unemployment crisis and how to resolve it.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Is entrepreneurship the magic solution to all this?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Wherever you see the African youth unemployment crisis mentioned, it is never far away from the word, entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship is being touted as the silver bullet for Africa’s unemployment crisis. Now allow me to preface my would-be next statement by saying that this is not an anti-entrepreneurship article. I consider myself an entrepreneur. I love entrepreneurship and I have wanted to be a social entrepreneur for as long as I remember.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However it is that very relationship that I have with entrepreneurship that makes me doubt the feasibility and understanding of the entrepreneurship being offered to solve our problems.  On the surface it is a good idea to tell hundreds of millions of skilled and educated people that can’t find work to create their own work, but just a few moments of engaging with that recommendation unveils a plethora of other problems and issues that need tending to before that solution can itself be implemented on a scale as the one that is required.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Submitting entrepreneurship as the solution to Africa’s youth unemployment crisis has the unintended consequence of recommending that Africa become a net entrepreneurial community.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But what the heck is a net entrepreneurial community?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I myself wasn’t familiar with the concept before I tried to put words to my thoughts about this big entrepreneurship silver bullet. I am not sure if anyone else has written about this or how they defined this concept, but since I came up with it for this blog post, I am going to define it as it applies to the context of this article.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A net entrepreneurial community is one where the local private sector, is the biggest employer in the community. The local private sector is exclusive of foreign multinationals, NGOs and government institutions. This therefore means that the local citizens themselves create the businesses and organizations that employ most of them and also solve the unique challenges faced by their society.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                They will probably do this through either manifesting a class of business owners, merchants and entrepreneurs or through a community ownership program, the former of which seems like the more likely occurrence.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So what does entrepreneurship really mean in the context of a solution to Africa’s youth unemployment issue?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And is it as simple as telling people to choose entrepreneurship and all of a sudden you have competent and capable entrepreneurs? That seems like a very short sighted understanding of entrepreneurship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What is the necessary infrastructure to establish such an operation?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Who is bothering to get into the mechanics of how to make Africa a net entrepreneurial society?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Can it even be achieve with the current social mindsets, structures and policies?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many of Africa’s countries still have the same education systems of the colonial era. Education systems that teach kids to pick a particular field of interest, if even, develop as much skill as possible in that one field so they can get good jobs, practicing what they studied in school.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Are these education systems equipped with the toolset to train continent saving entrepreneurs? Is entrepreneurship just the buzz word of the 21st century or is it actually a tried and tested ideology of mass social change?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Why the entrepreneurship-will-solve-it-all crusade is wrong
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Only someone that hasn’t engaged with the details and demands of entrepreneurship can use it as a one-suit fits all solution for the youth unemployment crisis. It is true that entrepreneurship, due to its exponential job creation effect can be the vehicle with which Africa averts the impending youth crisis. But in order for that to happen, it is going to take nothing short of a reorganization of our entire social fabric.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is not realistic to advocate entrepreneurship to the youth and yet maintain the same structures that were set up to inhibit Africa’s expansion and free expression of herself. Let me clarify. You can’t advocate entrepreneurship to the youth and yet maintain the same barriers to access to structured debt and financing on the international market.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Conversely, you can’t advocate entrepreneurship to Africa’s youth without opening the global market up to their products on competitive terms. You can’t advocate entrepreneurship to Africa’s youth and maintain the same policies and regulatory structures that favor long term establishment over new youth owned startups.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can’t advocate entrepreneurship to Africa’s youth and continue to teach them the same tired colonial propaganda that Africans have consumed as education for decades since the colonial era. Propaganda that was designed to create submissive colonial subjects, not free thinking entrepreneurs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lastly and probably most importantly, you can’t advocate for entrepreneurship to Africa’s youth without minimizing, at least in part, the opportunity cost and risk associated with entrepreneurship.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is reckless and irresponsible to sponsor a decade’s worth of campaigns and mentions of this big solution without so much as a feasibility study. There are a lot more failed entrepreneurs than successful ones. I don’t need to do any research to confirm that. It is a fact that can’t be refuted.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Can we honestly say that we are prepared to handle the demands of entrepreneurship? It’s incredibly low success rate? The high cost of setup both financially and socially? Are we prepared for the burden of entrepreneurship on our economies if it is not done well and to scale? I think Africa still has a lot of thinking and preparation to do before it can throw all its eggs in the entrepreneurship basket.
